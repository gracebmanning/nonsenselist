    discussion forum: anyone else getting haunted by an egg ghost? i think i have a ghost in my house and all he does is fuck with my eggs. 
    i make over easy eggs, he breaks my yolks. i make hard-boiled eggs, he peels them (that's the best part). 
    i make scrambled eggs, he eats them. he really likes them scrambled.
