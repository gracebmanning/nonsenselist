    I was just at the Whataburger off of N Interstate Hwy 35 in Austin, when a man walked in wearing a floor-length fur coat with no shirt underneath.
    As for his bottom half, it was just a pair of denim shorts and navy blue flats, like the Toms I wore in third grade.
    He was a white male with a long beard but completely bald, and I overheard him order a "Double Meat Whatameal with Lower Calorie Sides"
    ...(I have since learned that means apple slices and an unsweetened iced tea). Anyways...if you know this man, please let him know that he
    left his aviators on top of the soda machine and I'd like to find a way to give them back. Many thanks.
